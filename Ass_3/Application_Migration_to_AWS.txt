1) AWS Services which can be used are :

AWS EC2 instances  :  To migrate all the Servers on this instance
AWS EBS	volumes	   :  To migrate the Data on this Disk Volumes
AWS VPC            : Virtual Private Cloud - create an IPSec VPN tunnel that will allow resources running on AWS to communicate securely with resources at the
other end of the tunnel in your existing data center
RDBMS AMI's        : All of the major databases are available as Amazon Machine Images and are supported in the cloud by the vendors. Migrating your data from an on-premise
installation to an Amazon EC2 cloud instance is no different than migrating data from one machine to another.
Amazon SimpleDB    :  can be used for MongoDB migration

2) Forklift Migration Strategy  can be used for migrating the Stateless applications, tightly coupled applications, or self-contained applications

In this approach, rather than moving the pieces of system over the time, forklift or "pick it all up at once" and move it to the cloud.

Using this approach , you might be able to migrate an existing application into the cloud with few code changes. Most of the
changes will involve copying your application binaries, creating and configuring Amazon Machine Images, setting up
security groups and elastic IP addresses, DNS, switching to Amazon RDS databases. This is where AWS’s raw 
infrastructure services (Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon RDS and Amazon VPC) will come into picture.
